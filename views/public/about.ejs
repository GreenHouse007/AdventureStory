            every decision can unlock new scenes, endings, and achievements.

            Our admin tools let you build stories visually with nodes and
            choices, edit live content safely, and roll out updates without
            breaking player saves.

          <p>
            Minimal UI, concept-art illustrations (suggestive, not literal),
            dark mode by default, and crisp typography for long reads.
